  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>
  This plugin is pretty simple. For every request your browser makes to a website,
  two additional calls to random websites are generated. These websites are generated
  using common words and phrases. They may be real, popular websites, or they may be
  completely made-up by the randomizer. Over time the randomizer will get better and
  we'll be able to pollute the data stream with even more nonsense. If they're going
  to take our data, let's at least make the information less useful.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you're not aware of what's allowed to be sold now, without your permission and
  without any ability to opt-out:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Geographic location</li>
    <li>Children’s information</li>
    <li>Health information</li>
    <li>Financial information</li>
    <li>Social Security numbers (no, really!)</li>
    <li>Web browsing history</li>
    <li>App usage history</li>
    <li>The content of communications</li>
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>Your address</li>
    <li>Your IP address</li>
    <li>Your current subscription level</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Given that no one is asking for your permission to sell your personal information,
  let's at least make that data harder to use by polluting its content with nonsense.
  </p>

  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>
  Behind the scenes, without opening any browser tabs or interrupting your browsing activities,
  the extension will listen for outbound requests to websites. When a request is detected, it
  will generate two more random URL's and make requests at the same time for those two pages.
  You will never see the content and it doesn't mess with your browser history, so your experience
  will be just like normal.
  </p>

  <p>
  What the ISP's will see however is a bunch of traffic going to sites
  that you may or may not have actually visited or have any interest in at all. By adding noise to
  your browsing data, the ISP's will have no idea which sites you're actually visiting, making the
  data they steal less valuable.
  </p>

  <h2>How can I see it working?</h2>
  <p>
  Well, it's not really straightforward, but you can watch the traffic to see the requests if you
  really want to do so:

  <ol type="number">
    <li>Go to "Window > Extensions"</li>
    <li>Scroll to the "Subhref" item and click on the "Background Page" link by the word "Inspect Views". </li>
    <li>This will open an instance of the Google Inspector. </li>
    <li>Click on "Network" then check the "Preserve log" checkbox </li>
    <li>Leave that window open and go to any other browser tab </li>
    <li>Enter a new URL and press "Enter" </li>
    <li>Return to the "inspector" window and you will see a bunch of requests going out to randomly generated websites. </li>
  </ol>

  This will show you a list of all of the websites being accessed in the background as you browse.
  </p>

  <h2>Are you collecting this data?</h2>
  <p>
  No! Your browsing data is not captured, logged or transmitted to any third-party server
  or service by this extension. In the future anonymous data <i>might</i> be sent in to a
  remote server in order to facilitate "real url" network noise generation, but if and when
  that happens it will be opt-in only and will be completely anonymous!
  </p>

  <h2>Why is it a paid app?</h2>
  <p>
  This is a paid plugin because well, my time isn't free and if I'm going to maintain
  this as a tool for everyone then it will take some time. It's not expensive, but it
  does cost something. Your dollars go toward ensuring a better product and toward
  fighting the good fight. I will periodically make donations to the EFF and the ACLU
  on behalf of the users of the extension.
  </p>

  <h2>How can I help fight this problem?</h2>
  <p>
  Call your representatives and tell them this is a terrible idea, that your privacy is more important than
  the profits of a few large corporations and that you won't stand for this type of invasive legislation.
  Then go donate money to the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/button">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a>
  and/or the <a href="https://action.aclu.org">ACLU</a> to help organizations who stand up for our rights both online
  and in the physical world.
